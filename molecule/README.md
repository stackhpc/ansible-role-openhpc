Molecule tests for the role.

# Test Matrix

Test options in "Other" column flow down through table unless changed.

Test   | # Partitions | Groups in partitions?   | Other
---    | ---          | ---                     | ---
test1  | 1            | N                       | 2x compute node, sequential names (default test), config on all nodes
test1b | 1            | N                       | 1x compute node
test1c | 1            | N                       | 2x compute nodes, nonsequential names
test2  | 2            | N                       | 4x compute node, sequential names
test3  | 1            | Y                       | -
test4  | 1            | N                       | 2x compute node, accounting enabled
test5  | 1            | N                       | As for #1 but configless
test6  | 1            | N                       | 0x compute nodes, configless
test7  | 1            | N                       | 1x compute node, no login node so specified munge key, configless (checks image build should work)
test8  | 1            | N                       | 2x compute node, 2x login-only nodes, configless
test9  | 1            | N                       | As test8 but uses `--limit=testohpc-control,testohpc-compute-0` and checks login nodes still end up in slurm.conf
test10 | 1            | N                       | As for #5 but then tries to add an additional node
test11 | 1            | N                       | As for #5 but then deletes a node (actually changes the partition due to molecule/ansible limitations)
test12 | 1            | N                       | As for #5 but enabling job completion and testing `sacct -c`
test13 | 1            | N                       | As for #5 but tests `openhpc_config` variable.

# Local Installation & Running

Local installation on a CentOS 8 machine looks like:

    sudo yum install -y gcc python3-pip python3-devel openssl-devel python3-libselinux
    sudo yum install -y yum-utils
    sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
    sudo yum install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
    sudo yum install -y iptables
    sudo systemctl start docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
    # if not running as centos, also run:
    sudo usermod -aG docker centos
    newgrp docker
    docker run hello-world # test docker works without sudo

    sudo yum install -y git
    git clone git@github.com:stackhpc/ansible-role-openhpc.git
    cd ansible-role-openhpc/
    python3 -m venv venv
    . venv/bin/activate
    pip install -U pip
    pip install -r molecule/requirements.txt

Then to run tests, e.g.::

    cd ansible-role-openhpc/
    MOLECULE_IMAGE=centos:7 molecule test --all # NB some won't work as require OpenHPC v2.x (-> CentOS 8.x) features - see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
    MOLECULE_IMAGE=centos:8.2.2004 molecule test --all
    MOLECULE_IMAGE=centos:8.3.2011 molecule test --all

During development you may want to:

- See some debugging information by prepending:

        MOLECULE_NO_LOG="false" ...

- Prevent destroying insstances using:

        molecule test --destroy never
