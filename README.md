# stackhpc.openhpc

This Ansible role installs packages and performs configuration to provide an OpenHPC Slurm cluster. It can also be used to drain and resume nodes.

As a role it must be used from a playbook, for which a simple example is given below. This approach means it is totally modular with no assumptions about available networks or any cluster features except for some hostname conventions. Any desired cluster fileystem or other required functionality may be freely integrated using additional Ansible roles or other approaches.

The minimal image for nodes is a Centos7 or Centos8 cloud image. These use OpenHPC v1 and v2 respectively. Centos8/OpenHPCv2 is generally preferred as it provides additional functionality for Slurm, compilers, MPI and transport libraries.

Role Variables
--------------

`openhpc_release_repo`: Optional. Path to the `ohpc-release` repo to use. Defaults provide v1.3 for Centos 7 and v2 for Centos 8. Or, include this
package in the image.

`openhpc_slurm_service_enabled`: boolean, whether to enable the appropriate slurm service (slurmd/slurmctld)

`openhpc_slurm_service_started`: Optional boolean. Whether to start slurm services. If set to false, all services will be stopped. Defaults to `openhpc_slurm_service_enabled`.

`openhpc_slurm_control_host`: ansible host name of the controller e.g `"{{ groups['cluster_control'] | first }}"`

`openhpc_slurm_partitions`: list of one or more slurm partitions.  Each partition may contain the following values:
* `groups`: If there are multiple node groups that make up the partition, a list of group objects can be defined here.
  Otherwise, `groups` can be omitted and the following attributes can be defined in the partition object:
  * `name`: The name of the nodes within this group.
  * `cluster_name`: Optional.  An override for the top-level definition `openhpc_cluster_name`.
  * `ram_mb`: Optional.  The physical RAM available in each server of this group ([slurm.conf](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) parameter `RealMemory`). This is set to the Slurm default of `1` if not defined.

  For each group (if used) or partition there must be an ansible inventory group `<cluster_name>_<group_name>`. All nodes in this inventory group will be added to the group/partition. Nodes may have arbitrary hostnames but these should be lowercase to avoid a mismatch between inventory and actual hostname. Nodes in a group are assumed to be homogenous in terms of processor and memory.

* `default`: Optional.  A boolean flag for whether this partion is the default.  Valid settings are `YES` and `NO`.
* `maxtime`: Optional.  A partition-specific time limit in hours, minutes and seconds ([slurm.conf](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html) parameter `MaxTime`).  The default value is
  given by `openhpc_job_maxtime`.

`openhpc_job_maxtime`: A maximum time job limit in hours, minutes and seconds.  The default is `24:00:00`.

`openhpc_cluster_name`: name of the cluster

`openhpc_packages`: additional OpenHPC packages to install

`openhpc_enable`:
* `control`: whether to enable control host
* `batch`: whether to enable compute nodes
* `runtime`: whether to enable OpenHPC runtime
* `drain`: whether to drain compute nodes
* `resume`: whether to resume compute nodes

`openhpc_slurm_configless`: Optional, default False. If True then slurm's ["configless" mode](https://slurm.schedmd.com/configless_slurm.html) is used. **NB: Requires Centos8/OpenHPC v2.**

Example Inventory
-----------------

And an Ansible inventory as this:

    [openhpc_login]
    openhpc-login-0 ansible_host=10.60.253.40 ansible_user=centos

    [openhpc_compute]
    openhpc-compute-0 ansible_host=10.60.253.31 ansible_user=centos
    openhpc-compute-1 ansible_host=10.60.253.32 ansible_user=centos

    [cluster_login:children]
    openhpc_login

    [cluster_control:children]
    openhpc_login

    [cluster_batch:children]
    openhpc_compute

Example Playbooks
----------------

To deploy, create a playbook which looks like this:

    ---
    - hosts:
      - cluster_login
      - cluster_control
      - cluster_batch
      become: yes
      roles:
        - role: openhpc
          openhpc_enable:
            control: "{{ inventory_hostname in groups['cluster_control'] }}"
            batch: "{{ inventory_hostname in groups['cluster_batch'] }}"
            runtime: true
          openhpc_slurm_service_enabled: true
          openhpc_slurm_control_host: "{{ groups['cluster_control'] | first }}"
          openhpc_slurm_partitions:
            - name: "compute"
          openhpc_cluster_name: openhpc
          openhpc_packages: []
    ...

To drain nodes, for example, before scaling down the cluster to 6 nodes:

    ---
    - hosts: openstack
      gather_facts: false
      vars:
        partition: "{{ cluster_group.output_value | selectattr('group', 'equalto', item.name) | list }}"
        openhpc_slurm_partitions:
          - name: "compute"
            flavor: "compute-A"
            image: "CentOS7.5-OpenHPC"
            num_nodes: 6
            user: "centos"
        openhpc_cluster_name: openhpc
      roles:
        # Our stackhpc.cluster-infra role can be invoked in `query` mode which
        # looks up the state of the cluster by querying the Heat API.
        - role: stackhpc.cluster-infra
          cluster_name: "{{ cluster_name }}"
          cluster_state: query
          cluster_params:
            cluster_groups: "{{ cluster_groups }}"
      tasks:
        # Given that the original cluster that was created had 8 nodes and the
        # cluster we want to create has 6 nodes, the computed desired_state
        # variable stores the list of instances to leave untouched.
        - name: Count the number of compute nodes per slurm partition
          set_fact:
            desired_state: "{{ (( partition | first).nodes | map(attribute='name') | list )[:item.num_nodes] + desired_state | default([]) }}"
          when: partition | length > 0
          with_items: "{{ openhpc_slurm_partitions }}"
        - debug: var=desired_state

    - hosts: cluster_batch
      become: yes
      vars:
        desired_state: "{{ hostvars['localhost']['desired_state'] | default([]) }}"
      roles:
        # Now, the stackhpc.openhpc role is invoked in drain/resume modes where
        # the instances in desired_state are resumed if in a drained state and
        # drained if in a resumed state.
        - role: stackhpc.openhpc
          openhpc_slurm_control_host: "{{ groups['cluster_control'] | first }}"
          openhpc_enable:
            drain: "{{ inventory_hostname not in desired_state }}"
            resume: "{{ inventory_hostname in desired_state }}"
    ...
